Introduction & Business Problem\n\n### A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.\n    \nA common problem facing many people is choosing a place to live. Even after you have decided on a city, there can be an overwhelming number of options and tradeoffs to consider. This is also a space with a large amount of data that could help you to make better informed choices if you can integrate it in the right way.\n\nThe focus of this project will be on New York City's rental real estate market. A user will be able to specify certain criteria for their preferences and using this data science tool, provide back a set of potential housing options. Criteria include:\n\n- Max rent per month (i.e. $5,000 per month)\n- Number of bedrooms (i.e. 3 bedrooms)\n- Proximity to a metro station in the Manhattan area (i.e. within 1 mi radius)\n- Type of amenities in the neighborhood (i.e. Asian restaurants, coffee shops, gym, etc)\n\nThe goal of this project is to find a suitable apartment for rent in Manhattan NY that meets the requirements of price, and venue. The following section will detail the data sources required for the analysis. This problem is common to many large cities in the US and abroad. While the data used in this project is specific to Manhattan, the approach is common and can be applied more broadly.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2. Data Section\n\n### A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.\n\nBelow are the list of datasets required for this project:\n\n- Apartments for rent including price, address, # of beds\n- Manhattan neighborhoods including latitude and longitude\n- Venues for each neighborhood\n- Subway stations in Manhattan including address\n\nAddresses from rental realestate locations will be converted to lat/lon coordinates. Using Foursquare API we will map the top venues for all manhattan neighborhoods and cluster into groups. We will also convert the address of the subway to lat/long to determine the proximity to realestate listings. Data will be sourced from open data sources where available and using Foursquare api for venue information.\n\nIn addition to solving the primary problem of identifying the optimum place to live, the dataset will allow a user to look at:\n\n- What is the average rental price in each Manhattan neighborhood?\n- Is there a correlation between the price of real estate and proximity to subway stations?\n- What types of venues make up each Manhattan neighborhood?\n- Is there a correlation between the price and number of bedrooms or other realestate metrics?\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
